## What is AgentOps

AgentOps is a standalone framework for managing, monitoring, and safeguarding AI coding agents. It is not tied to any single platform or provider. AgentOps works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and any agent that operates through a CLI or editor integration. It gives engineering teams consistent oversight across every agent session through structured checkpoints, context monitoring, safety checks, and audit trails.

## Key Features

### Core Skills

- **Save Points** -- Automatic git checkpoints at configurable intervals, with branch-on-risk for dangerous operations.
- **Context Health** -- Monitors token usage and conversation length, warns before context windows overflow, and recommends session handoffs.
- **Standing Orders** -- Lints and enforces rules files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.) so agents stay aligned with project conventions.
- **Small Bets** -- Scores tasks by file count and complexity, flags oversized changes, and enforces incremental delivery.
- **Safety Checks** -- Scans for leaked secrets, validates permissions, and blocks commits containing sensitive data.

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Tracing** -- Structured span-based tracing for agent actions with OpenTelemetry-compatible context propagation.
- **Permissions** -- File-level and command-level permission enforcement with allowlist/denylist support.
- **Cost Management** -- Per-session and monthly budget tracking with configurable warn and hard-stop thresholds.
- **Lifecycle Management** -- Session start, checkpoint, and teardown hooks for repeatable agent workflows.
- **Audit Trail** -- Append-only event log capturing every significant agent action for post-hoc review.
- **Plugins** -- Community plugin loader for extending AgentOps with custom checks and integrations.
- **Evals** -- Built-in evaluation harness for testing safety rules against known attack patterns.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AgenticManagement
```

2. Copy the `agentops/` directory into your target project:

```bash
cp -r agentops/ /path/to/your/project/agentops/
```

3. Set up git hooks:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

4. For Claude Code, copy the slash commands and add hook entries:

```bash
cp -r agentops/.claude/commands/agentops/ .claude/commands/agentops/
```

Then add the following to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{ "command": "bash agentops/scripts/permission-enforcer.sh" }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "command": "bash agentops/scripts/post-write-checks.sh" }],
    "SessionStart": [{ "command": "bash agentops/scripts/session-start-checks.sh" }]
  }
}
```

5. Verify the installation:

```
/agentops check
```

## Slash Commands

- `/agentops check` -- Run all health and safety checks against the current session.
- `/agentops audit` -- Generate a full security audit report for the project.
- `/agentops scaffold` -- Create standard planning and workflow files from templates.

## Dashboard

The AgentOps dashboard is a single HTML file with no external dependencies.

<!-- Screenshot placeholder: agentops/dashboard/screenshot.png -->

To open it locally:

```bash
open agentops/dashboard/agentops-dashboard.html
# Or serve it:
npx serve agentops/dashboard/
```
